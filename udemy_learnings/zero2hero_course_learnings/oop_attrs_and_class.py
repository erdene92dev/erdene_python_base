### Object Oriented Programing is referred to as OPP
### OOP allows users to create their own objects that have 
### customizedd functions in them
### functions within classes() are more repeatable, scalable, 
### and look more organized, hence, easy to refer to

# # OOP example Dog that has the function breed given user input

# class animal():
# 	## class object
# 	species = 'dog'

# 	## date object
	
# 	## user defined object
# 	def __init__(self, breed, name, age):
# 		self.breed = breed
# 		self.name = name
# 		self.age = age


# dog_df = Dog(breed='Husky',name='Miko',age=5)
# dog_df_sentence = (f"You're dog species is{dog_df.breed}")

# print(dog_df.breed)
